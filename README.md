This module is an attempt to easily pass FISMA for RHEL/CENTOS 6. Due to not finding any similar modules I decided to start this one. If you have any questions/suggestions/other please message me.

This module requires https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/stdlib

Of note: I will be switching to the sysctl module for any sysctl changes.
